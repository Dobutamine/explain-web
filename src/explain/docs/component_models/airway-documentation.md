# Airway Class Documentation

## Overview

The `Airway` class extends the `GasCapacitance` class to specifically model airway segments in the neonatal respiratory system. It inherits gas-specific properties while providing a framework for airway-specific behavior in the respiratory tract.

## Location

`Airway.js` in the model structure.

## Import Dependencies

```javascript
import { GasCapacitance } from "../base_models/GasCapacitance";
```

The class extends the GasCapacitance class which provides the gas compartment functionality.

## Class Structure

### Static Properties

```javascript
static model_type = "Airway";
```

- `model_type`: Identifies this class as an "Airway" model

### Constructor

```javascript
constructor(model_ref, name = "")
```

**Parameters:**
- `model_ref`: Reference to the model engine
- `name`: Optional name for the model instance (defaults to empty string)

### Methods

#### `calc_model()`

Orchestrates the calculation sequence for the airway model.

**Functionality:**
1. Calls `calc_resistances()` to update resistance properties
2. Calls `calc_elastances()` to update elastance values (inherited from GasCapacitance)
3. Calls `calc_volumes()` to update volume values (inherited from GasCapacitance)
4. Calls `calc_pressure()` to calculate the resulting pressures (inherited from GasCapacitance)

#### `calc_resistances()`

Placeholder method for airway-specific resistance calculations. Currently empty in the implementation.

## Physiological Significance

The Airway class represents segments of the respiratory tract with these potential features:

1. **Anatomical Structure**:
   - Models segments of the respiratory tract (trachea, bronchi, bronchioles)
   - Inherits the gas compartment properties for respiratory gases

2. **Mechanical Properties**:
   - Inherits elastance properties from GasCapacitance
   - Framework for implementing airway resistance calculations
   - Potential for modeling dynamic airway behavior

3. **Gas Dynamics**:
   - Full gas composition tracking from parent class
   - Temperature and humidity effects
   - Pressure relationships with surrounding structures

4. **Potential Extensions**:
   - Though minimally implemented in the provided code, the structure allows for:
     - Dynamic airway resistance (e.g., bronchoconstriction)
     - Airway collapse during negative pressure
     - Mucosal effects on gas properties
     - Pathological states like bronchospasm or obstruction

## Usage Example

```javascript
// Create an airway model for the trachea
const trachea = new Airway(modelEngine, "trachea");

// Initialize with physiological parameters
trachea.u_vol = 0.05;           // Unstressed volume of 50 mL
trachea.el_base = 0.5;          // Baseline elastance of 0.5 mmHg/mL
trachea.vol = 0.07;             // Initial volume of 70 mL
trachea.temp = 37.0;            // Temperature in Celsius
trachea.humidity = 0.95;        // 95% humidity

// Initialize gas composition
trachea.co2 = 8.5;              // Oxygen concentration (mmol/L)
trachea.cco2 = 0.5;             // Carbon dioxide concentration (mmol/L)
trachea.cn2 = 34.0;             // Nitrogen concentration (mmol/L)

// Enable the model
trachea.is_enabled = true;
```

## Notes

- The Airway class is a thin extension of GasCapacitance with a framework for airway-specific behavior
- The current implementation is minimal, with an empty `calc_resistances()` method suggesting intended future development
- It inherits all gas properties, thermodynamics, and water vapor handling from GasCapacitance
- The model structure allows for future implementation of:
  - Airway resistance that varies with lung volume
  - Bronchomotor tone controlled by autonomic signals
  - Dynamic airway collapse during forced expiration
  - Effects of respiratory diseases on airway properties
- This class likely serves as a base for more specialized airway models in the respiratory system
