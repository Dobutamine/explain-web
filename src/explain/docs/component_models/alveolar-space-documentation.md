# AlveolarSpace Class Documentation

## Overview

The `AlveolarSpace` class extends the `GasCapacitance` class to specifically model alveolar gas compartments in the neonatal respiratory system. It represents the terminal air sacs where gas exchange with the pulmonary capillaries occurs.

## Location

`AlveolarSpace.js` in the model structure.

## Import Dependencies

```javascript
import { GasCapacitance } from "../base_models/GasCapacitance";
```

The class extends the GasCapacitance class which provides the gas compartment functionality.

## Class Structure

### Static Properties

```javascript
static model_type = "AlveolarSpace";
```

- `model_type`: Identifies this class as an "AlveolarSpace" model

### Inherited Functionality

While the provided implementation is minimal, the class inherits all functionality from the GasCapacitance parent class:

- Volume and pressure calculations
- Gas composition tracking (O₂, CO₂, N₂, H₂O, other gases)
- Temperature and humidity effects
- Thermal dynamics
- Response to external pressures

## Physiological Significance

The AlveolarSpace class represents the terminal respiratory units with these key features:

1. **Gas Exchange Interface**:
   - Primary site for oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange with blood
   - Thin interface (blood-gas barrier) between air and pulmonary capillaries
   - Large surface area (approximately 70 m² in adults, proportionally smaller in neonates)

2. **Respiratory Mechanics**:
   - Subject to elastic recoil forces from surrounding lung tissue
   - Influenced by surfactant reducing surface tension
   - Volume changes with breathing cycle

3. **Gas Composition**:
   - Alveolar gas differs from atmospheric and dead space gas
   - Higher CO₂ concentration than inspired air
   - Lower O₂ concentration than inspired air
   - Near 100% humidity at body temperature

4. **Neonatal Specifics**:
   - Developing alveoli with different elastic properties
   - Surfactant production may be limited in premature infants
   - Rapid respiratory rates affecting gas equilibration
   - Higher oxygen consumption per unit mass than adults

## Usage Example

```javascript
// Create an alveolar space model
const alveoli = new AlveolarSpace(modelEngine, "alveolar_space");

// Initialize with physiological parameters
alveoli.u_vol = 0.02;          // Unstressed volume of 20 mL
alveoli.el_base = 1.0;         // Baseline elastance of 1.0 mmHg/mL
alveoli.el_k = 0.05;           // Non-linear elastance factor
alveoli.vol = 0.03;            // Initial volume of 30 mL
alveoli.temp = 37.0;           // Body temperature in Celsius
alveoli.humidity = 1.0;        // 100% humidity

// Initialize gas composition
alveoli.co2 = 5.8;             // Oxygen concentration (mmol/L)
alveoli.cco2 = 6.1;            // Carbon dioxide concentration (mmol/L)
alveoli.cn2 = 32.0;            // Nitrogen concentration (mmol/L)
alveoli.ch2o = 6.3;            // Water vapor (mmol/L)

// Enable the model
alveoli.is_enabled = true;

// Example of simulating effects of respiratory cycle
// Inspiration - increased volume and reduced pressure
alveoli.pres_ext = -5.0;       // Negative pressure from respiratory muscles

// Example of simulating respiratory distress syndrome (RDS)
alveoli.el_base = 3.0;         // Increased elastance due to surfactant deficiency
```

## Notes

- The AlveolarSpace class is a minimal extension of GasCapacitance specifically for alveolar modeling
- Currently, it only defines a unique model_type without adding additional functionality
- It inherits all gas properties, thermodynamics, and water vapor handling from GasCapacitance
- Typically used in conjunction with GasExchanger to model pulmonary gas exchange
- The model can represent both normal and pathological alveolar conditions:
  - Normal alveolar function with appropriate gas exchange
  - Respiratory distress syndrome with increased elastance
  - Pulmonary edema with decreased effective volume
  - Atelectasis with collapsed alveoli
- Neonatal alveolar spaces have unique characteristics:
  - Fewer alveoli than adults (alveolar development continues after birth)
  - Different surfactant composition and quantity
  - Higher compliance in term infants, lower in premature infants
  - More vulnerable to collapse (atelectasis)
- This class is likely used with specialized parameters to model the developing neonatal lungs
