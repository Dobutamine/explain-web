# AirwayResistor Class Documentation

## Overview

The `AirwayResistor` class extends the `Resistor` class to specifically model flow resistance in airways of the neonatal respiratory system. Though minimally implemented in the provided code, it establishes a foundation for respiratory-specific resistance modeling.

## Location

`AirwayResistor.js` in the model structure.

## Import Dependencies

```javascript
import { Resistor } from "../base_models/Resistor";
```

The class extends the Resistor class which provides the basic flow resistance functionality.

## Class Structure

### Static Properties

```javascript
static model_type = "AirwayResistor";
```

- `model_type`: Identifies this class as an "AirwayResistor" model

### Inherited Functionality

While the provided implementation is minimal, the class inherits all functionality from the Resistor parent class:

- Flow calculation based on pressure difference and resistance
- Separate forward and backward resistance values
- Non-linear resistance effects
- Flow control capabilities
- Volume transfer between compartments

## Physiological Significance

The AirwayResistor class represents resistance elements in the respiratory tract with these potential features:

1. **Airflow Dynamics**:
   - Models airflow resistance between respiratory compartments
   - Potential for modeling pressure-driven flow in conducting airways

2. **Respiratory Mechanics**:
   - Could represent various levels of the bronchial tree
   - Framework for implementing diameter-dependent resistance (Poiseuille's law)
   - Potential for modeling dynamic airway resistance changes

3. **Pathophysiological States**:
   - Structure allows for modeling of bronchoconstriction/bronchodilation
   - Could implement obstruction effects (asthma, mucus, foreign bodies)
   - Potential for modeling airway collapse during forced expiration

4. **Potential Extensions**:
   - Though minimally implemented, the structure allows for:
     - Flow direction dependence (inspiratory vs. expiratory resistance)
     - Lung volume dependence of airway resistance
     - Autonomic control of bronchomotor tone
     - Gas composition effects on airway resistance

## Usage Example

```javascript
// Create an airway resistor for a bronchiole segment
const bronchioleResistor = new AirwayResistor(modelEngine, "bronchiole_resistor");

// Initialize with physiological parameters (inherited from Resistor)
bronchioleResistor.r_for = 20;           // Forward resistance of 20 mmHg/(L·s)
bronchioleResistor.r_back = 25;          // Slightly higher backward resistance
bronchioleResistor.r_k = 5;              // Non-linear resistance factor
bronchioleResistor.comp_from = "terminal_bronchiole";  // Upstream component
bronchioleResistor.comp_to = "alveolar_duct";          // Downstream component
bronchioleResistor.no_back_flow = false;  // Allow bidirectional flow

// Enable the model
bronchioleResistor.is_enabled = true;

// Example of simulating bronchoconstriction
bronchioleResistor.r_factor = 3.0;  // Triple the resistance to represent severe bronchoconstriction
```

## Notes

- The AirwayResistor class is a minimal extension of Resistor specifically for respiratory modeling
- Currently, it only defines a unique model_type without adding additional functionality
- It inherits all flow calculation, resistance properties, and volume transfer methods from Resistor
- The model structure allows for future implementation of:
  - Poiseuille's law for laminar flow in airways (R ∝ 1/r⁴)
  - Turbulent flow in larger airways
  - Dynamic airway resistance changes with lung volume
  - Respiratory disease models
- This class likely works in conjunction with the Airway class to form the respiratory flow network
- The lack of additional implementation suggests this may be a placeholder for future development
